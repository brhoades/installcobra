InstallCobra
============

InstallCobra will be a Python-based replacement for Missouri S&T's Perl-based InstallMonkey. It is intended to be lightweight and make extensive use of OOP paradigms and external libraries.

Forward
=======

InstallCobra uses Python 3.4. All code written for InstallCobra will strictly follow PEP 8, as can be seen here:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

InstallCobra, unlike InstallMonkey, will be extensively modularized; including the primary module will not include all of its functions.
